 * -----------------------------------------
 * This service is a class representing an Outing object as manipulated by the local database.
 * Whenever some code wants to used Outing data object, it should do so by manipulating an instance of this class.
 * You can either create an Outing object with its raw data using the constructor,
 * or by using the static createFromObject factory method (like when fetchning data from LokiJS)
